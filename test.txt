We'll do it all, everything, on our own 
We don't need anything or anyone 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world 

I don't quite know how to say how I feel 
Those three words are said too much 
They're not enough 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world 
Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads 
I need your grace
to remind me
to find my own

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world 
Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

All that I am 
All that I ever was 
Is here in your perfect eyes 
They're all I can see 
I don't know where 
Confused about how as well 
I just know that these things 
Will never change for us at all 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world

Hi my name is ios

City of stars,
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars,
There's so much that i can't see.
Who knows
I felt it from the first embrace
I shared with you.
That now, Our dreams,
They've finally come true.

City of stars,
Just one thing everybody wants.
There in the bars
and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants.

It's love
Yes, all we're looking for
is love from someone else

A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

To look in somebody's eyes,
To light up the skies,
To open the world and send me reeling,
A voice that says i'll be here 
and you'll be alright
I don't care if I know just where I will go
Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
And rat-a-tat of my heart
I think I want it to stay

City of stars,
Are you shinning just for me?
City of stars,
You never shined so brightly
