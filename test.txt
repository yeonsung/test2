We'll do it all, everything, on our own 
We don't need anything or anyone 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world 

I don't quite know how to say how I feel 
Those three words are said too much 
They're not enough 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world 
Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads 
I need your grace
to remind me
to find my own

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world 
Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

All that I am 
All that I ever was 
Is here in your perfect eyes 
They're all I can see 
I don't know where 
Confused about how as well 
I just know that these things 
Will never change for us at all 

If I lay here 
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me 
And just forget the world
